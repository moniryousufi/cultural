          <p>More than 99% of the people of Afghanistan are Muslim. Islam has a strong presence in all aspects of the social, cultural, and political life of the people.
            Although there are non-Muslim minorities in Afghanistan, their numbers are very small. For example:

Hindus and Sikhs: Once a significant population, their numbers have declined in recent years due to wars and religious pressures.

Christians and Jews: They have a very limited presence and live mostly in secret.<br>
The religion of Islam has a strong presence in all stages of life. The people of Afghanistan have incorporated Islam not only in their worship, but also in their daily behavior, speech, culture, law, education, and even their economy.
Children are usually introduced to religion from an early age by hearing the call to prayer, hearing their parents recite the Quran, or attending mosques and schools. Families often try to raise their children based on Islamic values.
In society, respect for scholars and clergy is very important. Many people place great importance on the words of mullahs or religious advice. In some villages, if a dispute arises between two people, instead of going to court, they go to a mullah or tribal elder to "arbitrate" the case; that is, to resolve it based on religion and tradition.
<br> Religion is a constant presence in the education system. Religious subjects are taught in schools, and religious schools or Islamic schools are very popular for those who want to become religious scholars.
In general, Islam in Afghanistan is not just a mental belief; it is woven into the fabric of people's lives. For the Afghan people, religion is an identity, a guide, a hope, and a source of peace; even in the midst of wars, poverty, and hardships, religion has always been a point of support for them.

        Afghan literature is the soul of this land; it shows how people think, how they live, what they love and what they fight against. This literature is a colorful world full of poetry, stories, legends, lullabies, proverbs, anecdotes, riddles, prose, prayers, narratives and...

Afghan literature is both ancient and alive. Since the time when books and pens were not yet official, people used to tell their legends and stories to each other in spoken language. 
The literature of Afghanistan, like a great river that flows from the heart of the mountains, has passed through hardships, but it is still clear and flowing. Still, the children of this land, when they want to show love to someone, or to take heart, or to talk about the homeland, turn to poetry and stories.
Especially poetry. Poetry for the people of Afghanistan is not just a field of literature; One soul, one language of the heart, a narration of pain, joy, love and homeland. Poetry has been with the people of Afghanistan for centuries. When you are at peace, singing poetry; When there was war, resisting poetry; When falling in love, reading poetry; And when they get hurt, they whisper poetry.
Many great Persian poets, such as Rumi, Sanai and Naser Khosrow, originated in this land. But poetry in Afghanistan is not just for the elders, poetry belongs to the people; From a housewife to a schoolboy, from a mountain shepherd to a university professor. Poetry is like a companion to people. At nights, weddings, or even work.

       <p> Traditional Afghan music reflects the rich culture, complex history, and ethnic diversity of the country. Afghanistan is home to many ethnic groups such as Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and others—each with its own unique musical style, yet all united by a deep love for poetry, instruments, and singing. Afghan folk music is typically performed using traditional instruments, and it often features romantic, epic, or spiritual poetry. One of the most famous cultural expressions is the Attan dance and music, commonly performed at weddings and celebrations. Different regions have their own rhythms and styles: the north tends to have more rhythmic music, the Hazara areas are known for emotional and melancholic songs, and cities like Kabul and Herat feature a blend of traditional and modern influences. Overall, Afghan music—like its people—is warm, deep, and full of feeling; a voice that simultaneously sings of both the pain and joy of life.

      <p> Afghan traditional and local clothing is one of the most beautiful expressions of the country's culture, deeply rooted in its history, climate, and ethnic diversity. These clothes are not only worn for covering but also to reflect identity, artistry, and the personal taste of the people. Every region in Afghanistan has its own unique style, but in general, Afghan clothing is colorful, well-crafted, and full of intricate patterns. The fabrics are often shiny, velvety, or embroidered with gold and silver threads, and decorated with hand embroidery, mirror work, beads, and coins.

        Women's clothing usually consists of a long dress with wide trousers and a long scarf or shawl, all richly decorated by hand and often worn during celebrations, weddings, and special events. Men's clothing is simpler yet dignified—typically a long shirt with loose pants, paired with a vest or a traditional overcoat called a chapan, and in some areas, they also wear turbans or local caps. The color of the clothes varies by region—some wear darker tones, others brighter—but they all have one thing in common: deep respect for tradition and cultural roots.
        
        Even today, especially during weddings and holidays, people proudly wear their traditional clothing to show that their heritage is still alive. These clothes are more than just garments—they are a form of art, a way of storytelling through fabric, thread, and color.</p>

      <p> Afghan cuisine is one of the most delicious and colorful aspects of the country’s culture, combining the flavors of Central Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia. The main ingredients in most dishes include rice, meat, vegetables, and aromatic spices. Afghan dishes are usually cooked with love, patience, and attention to detail, and they’re often made for gatherings and family events.

        Kabuli Pulao is the most famous Afghan dish, made with rice, meat, carrots, raisins, and spices. Its sweet and savory flavor makes a beautiful combination.
        Mantu and Ashak Pulao are popular steamed dumplings filled with minced meat and onions, served with yogurt and a special sauce.
        Ashak is a more vegetarian-style dish, filled with leeks and herbs, and topped with yogurt and minced meat.
        
        Kebabs also hold a special place—especially the skewered kind, made with fresh meat grilled over charcoal.
        Shorwa is a traditional soup made with meat, vegetables, chickpeas, and potatoes, and it’s especially loved in the winter.
        Bolani (a type of flatbread stuffed with potatoes, leeks, or lentils) is a light, delicious, and popular choice for breakfast or afternoon snacks.
        
        Afghan bread comes in various types like tandoori naan, oily bread, and "barati" bread, and it’s always a staple on Afghan tables.
        Drinks like doogh (yogurt-based beverage), green or black tea, and traditional sweets like jalebi, kulcha (cookies), and baklava are also commonly served during gatherings.
        
        Overall, Afghan food is not only rich in flavor and spice but also a reflection of the people’s hospitality and deep-rooted culture. At every Afghan table, you’ll find both taste and warmth.</p>

     <p>The festivals and celebrations of the Afghan people are among the most beautiful expressions of their culture and social life. These events are a mix of religious traditions, ancient customs, ethnic rituals, and even seasonal changes. Despite the hardships they may face, Afghans always seek opportunities to celebrate, gather together, and keep their traditions alive.

        Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are two of the most important and widely celebrated festivals across the country. After a month of fasting or completing the Hajj pilgrimage, people wear new clothes, prepare special meals, attend Eid prayers at the mosque, and visit family and friends. These days are filled with kindness, forgiveness, and a warm sense of unity among families and communities.
        
        Nowruz, the Afghan New Year, marks the beginning of spring and is one of the most joyful and meaningful celebrations. People prepare “Haft Mewa” (seven fruits), wear new clothes, visit elders, and in provinces like Balkh, the Red Flower Festival (Gul-e-Surkh) is held with great beauty. Music, dancing, and traditional games help people celebrate nature’s renewal and the hope of a new year.
        
        Weddings are another important type of celebration with their own special world. Afghan weddings usually last for several days and include various stages such as engagement, Nikah (marriage contract), Henna night, and the main wedding ceremony. Music, traditional group dances like the Attan, and colorful, decorated outfits bring life to these events. Families and guests come together to sing, dance, and share joy late into the night.
        
        In some regions, there are local celebrations such as circumcision ceremonies for boys, religious vow offerings, or traditional harvest festivals. These events also show how much Afghans value culture, community, and shared happiness.
        
        Celebrations in Afghanistan are not just for fun—they are a way to be together, to preserve traditions, strengthen family and social ties, and keep their native culture strong. No matter where they are, Afghans carry the spirit of these celebrations in their hearts, because these joyful moments are deeply rooted in their identity.</p>
